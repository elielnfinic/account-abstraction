# account-abstraction

Hey Starknet Developers, I created this repository to have a full implementation of the Account Abstraction based on David Barreto(@barretodavid) articles on Medium.

Here are the links to David Barreto articles:
- [Account Abstraction: Part 1](https://medium.com/starknet-edu/account-abstraction-on-starknet-part-i-2ff84c6a3c30)
- [Account Abstraction: Part 2](https://medium.com/starknet-edu/account-abstraction-on-starknet-part-ii-24d52874e0bd)
- [Account Abstraction: Part 3](https://medium.com/starknet-edu/account-abstraction-on-starknet-part-iii-698904e7792c)


Starknet ecosystem is growing fast and changes are happening every day. I have updated the code to the latest version of Starknet.

I hope you enjoy it and feel free to contribute to this repository.
